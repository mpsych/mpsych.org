abstract = {Background and Purpose: Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) may be associated with carotid artery plaques with <50\% stenosis. Plaque vulnerability is multifactorial, possibly related to intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), lipid-rich necrotic core, perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), and calcifications. Machine learning (ML)-based plaque classification is increasingly popular but often limited in clinical interpretability by black-box nature. We applied an explainable ML approach, using noncalcified plaque components and calcification features with the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework to classify plaques as culprit or nonculprit. Methods: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study. Patients with unilateral anterior circulation ESUS with calcified carotid plaques in neck computed tomography (CT) angiography were analyzed. Calcification-level features were derived from manual segmentations. Plaque-level features were assessed by a neuroradiologist and by semi-automated software. Plaques were classified as culprit if ipsilateral to stroke side. Eight classifiers were benchmarked, and a gradient-boosted decision tree (CatBoost) was further tuned. SHAP explained model decisions. Results: Seventy patients yielded 116 calcified plaques (270 calcifications). Model based on five plaque- and calcification-level features achieved ROC-AUC (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve) 0.79 and precision-recall-AUC 0.86, outperforming classification based on plaque thickness ≥ 3 mm (ROC-AUC 0.59, p = 0.04) and IPH presence (ROC-AUC 0.51, p = 0.003). SHAP identified plaque thickness and PVAT volume as the most influential features with potential thresholds of >2.6mm and ≥112 mm^3, respectively. Conclusions: ML model trained with noncalcified plaque and calcification features can classify culprit calcified carotid plaque better than conventional criteria. Using clinically interpretable features with SHAP, the model explained its decisions and suggested hypothesis-generating thresholds.},

  abstract={Among public universities in the New England
region of the United States, the University of Massachusetts
Boston (UMB) is the most ethnically diverse. Enrollment data in
the Computer Science (CS) department there closely aligns with
the broader demographic composition of the university, with over
half of CS majors identifying as students of color, a trend that
deviates from national patterns. However, the department
demographics exhibit a gender disparity, with male students
outnumbering female students at a ratio of five to one, consistent
with both national and global trends in CS. The disparity is even
higher when an intersectional lens is applied: attracting and
retaining Black and Indigenous Women of Color (BIWOC)
students, especially Black and Latina women, in the CS program
remains a significant challenge. Here, an exploratory
phenomenological case study utilizing participatory action
research was conducted to examine the lived experiences of female
Black and Latina students in the CS department. A preliminary
survey informed focus group topics of discussion. Thematic coding
of focus group discussions was undertaken to achieve two
objectives: (1) to develop actionable recommendations for
improving the recruitment and retention of students of color and
women, and (2) establish research experience for the female
participants so they may benefit tangibly from their contribution.
Key themes identified included resistance to BIWOC students,
mostly in the form of questioning capabilities and other
microaggressions, background mental labor in responding to or
actively ignoring that resistance, navigating the world as it is
versus trying to change it for the better, the need for counterspaces to share experiences of microaggressions and develop
success strategies, and potential benefits of a BIWOC research
hub, open to all students but with a focus on BIWOC students.},

  abstract={Stroke remains a leading cause of death globally, with calcified plaque in the carotid artery being a significant risk factor. Evaluating the impact of calcified carotid plaque, particularly in patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), is critical yet challenging. Manual segmentation, essential for assessing stroke risk, is time-consuming, and conventional methods like 2D and 3D UNet often struggle with the small size of calcified plaques. 
Therefore, this paper introduces a two-step segmentation process. First, segments the carotid artery to narrow the search space and focus on the region of interest around the artery. Then, it segments the calcified plaque within that targeted region. This approach achieves an intersection over union (IoU) of 0.9412 for the 2D model and 0.8095 for the 3D model, outperforming the baseline methods that directly segment plaques.

  abstract={This paper presents a systematic study of the generalization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and humans on relational reasoning tasks with bar charts. We first revisit previous experiments on graphical perception and update the benchmark performance of CNNs. We then test the generalization performance of CNNs on a classic relational reasoning task: estimating bar length ratios in a bar chart, by progressively perturbing the standard visualizations. We further conduct a user study to compare the performance of CNNs and humans. Our results show that CNNs outperform humans only when the training and test data have the same visual encodings. Otherwise, they may perform worse. We also find that CNNs are sensitive to perturbations in various visual encodings, regardless of their relevance to the target bars. Yet, humans are mainly influenced by bar lengths. Our study suggests that robust relational reasoning with visualizations is challenging for CNNs. Improving CNNs' generalization performance may require training them to better recognize task-related visual properties.},

  abstract={Significance: In in-line digital holographic microscopy (DHM), twin-image artifacts pose a significant challenge, and reduction or complete elimination is essential for object reconstruction.

Aim: To facilitate object reconstruction using a single hologram, significantly reduce inaccuracies, and avoid iterative processing, a digital holographic reconstruction algorithm called phase-support constraint on phase-only function (PCOF) is presented.

Approach: In-line DHM simulations and tabletop experiments employing the sliding-window approach are used to compute the arithmetic mean and variance of the phase values in the reconstructed image. A support constraint mask, through variance thresholding, effectively enabled twin-image artifacts.

Results: Quantitative evaluations using metrics such as mean squared error, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and mean structural similarity index show PCOF's superior capability in eliminating twin-image artifacts and achieving high-fidelity reconstructions compared with conventional methods such as angular spectrum and iterative phase retrieval methods.

Conclusions: PCOF stands as a promising approach to in-line digital holographic reconstruction, offering a robust solution to mitigate twin-image artifacts and enhance the fidelity of reconstructed objects.},

Our framework employs an emotion recognition model to detect expressions through facial recordings. Then, we evaluate a user's heart rate by amplifying changes in skin coloration through Eulerian Video Magnification. Finally, we analyze differentials in eyebrow and lip movements. We combine these three measurements to output a final stress score per unit of time. Our chosen emotion recognition model achieves an accuracy of 96.46%, and our remote heart rate detection module has a mean absolute error of 5.79 BPM. We provide a web-based application that allows for rapid, contactless stress detection through a webcam. We achieve over 84% accuracy on a dataset of video clips with individuals labeled as undergoing low, moderate, or high-stress levels. All code and data are openly available.},

ABSTRACT = {In drug-resistant epilepsy, a visual inspection of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) signals is often needed to localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and guide neurosurgery. The visual assessment of iEEG time-frequency (TF) images is an alternative to signal inspection, but subtle variations may escape the human eye. Here, we propose a deep learning-based metric of visual complexity to interpret TF images extracted from iEEG data and aim to assess its ability to identify the EZ in the brain. We analyzed interictal iEEG data from 1928 contacts recorded from 20 children with drug-resistant epilepsy who became seizure-free after neurosurgery. We localized each iEEG contact in the MRI, created TF images (1–70 Hz) for each contact, and used a pre-trained VGG16 network to measure their visual complexity by extracting unsupervised activation energy (UAE) from 13 convolutional layers. We identified points of interest in the brain using the UAE values via patient- and layer-specific thresholds (based on extreme value distribution) and using a support vector machine classifier. Results show that contacts inside the seizure onset zone exhibit lower UAE than outside, with larger differences in deep layers (L10, L12, and L13: p < 0.001). Furthermore, the points of interest identified using the support vector machine, localized the EZ with 7 mm accuracy. In conclusion, we presented a pre-surgical computerized tool that facilitates the EZ localization in the patient’s MRI without requiring long-term iEEG inspection.},

Manually removing these images is tedious and error-prone. Our two-stage process first uses threshold-based 5-bin histogram filtering to eliminate undesirable images, followed by a variational autoencoder to remove remaining low-quality scans. Our method detects such scans with an F1 Score of 0.8862 and preserves 163,568 high-quality mammograms. We provide results and tools publicly available as open-source software.},

If we can identify the family a protein belongs to, we can predict features without knowing the exact structure of such a protein. However, this grouping process is challenging. We propose a two-stage algorithm that classifies proteins into families by combining a dimensionality reduction technique using a variational autoencoder with learned fingerprint representations using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our models use fewer parameters than existing methods but perform better, with our variational autoencoder achieving 94% accuracy in reconstructing the most common amino acid in a sequence alignment, and the neural network provides 98-100% accuracy in classifying protein families. We developed a software framework to access our algorithms. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/ramindehghanpoor/CLI.},

abstract = {We present AutoDOViz, an interactive user interface for automated decision optimization (AutoDO) using reinforcement learning (RL). Decision optimization (DO) has classically being practiced by dedicated DO researchers [43] where experts need to spend long periods of time fine tuning a solution through trial-and-error. AutoML pipeline search has sought to make it easier for a data scientist to find the best machine learning pipeline by leveraging automation to search and tune the solution. More recently, these advances have been applied to the domain of AutoDO [36], with a similar goal to find the best reinforcement learning pipeline through algorithm selection and parameter tuning. However, Decision Optimization requires significantly more complex problem specification when compared to an ML problem. AutoDOViz seeks to lower the barrier of entry for data scientists in problem specification for reinforcement learning problems, leverage the benefits of AutoDO algorithms for RL pipeline search and finally, create visualizations and policy insights in order to facilitate the typical interactive nature when communicating problem formulation and solution proposals between DO experts and domain experts. In this paper, we report our findings from semi-structured expert interviews with DO practitioners as well as business consultants, leading to design requirements for human-centered automation for DO with RL. We evaluate a system implementation with data scientists and find that they are significantly more open to engage in DO after using our proposed solution. AutoDOViz further increases trust in RL agent models and makes the automated training and evaluation process more comprehensible. As shown for other automation in ML tasks [33, 59], we also conclude automation of RL for DO can benefit from user and vice-versa when the interface promotes human-in-the-loop.},

abstract={In Connectomics, researchers are creating the brain's wiring diagram at nanometer resolution. As part of this processing workflow, 2D electron microscopy (EM) images must be aligned to 3D volumes. However, existing alignment methods are computationally expensive and can take a long time. We hypothesize that adding biological features improve and accelerate the alignment procedure. Since especially mitochondria can be detected accurately and fast, we propose a new alignment method, MITO, that uses these structures as landmark points. With MITO, we can decrease the alignment time by 27%, and our experiments indicate a throughput of 33 Megapixels/s, which is faster than the acquisition speed of current microscopes. We can align an image volume of 1268x1524x160 voxels in less than 12s. We compare our method to the following feature generators: ORB, BRISK, FAST, and FREAK.},

ABSTRACT={Epilepsy affects more than three million people in the United States. In approximately one-third of this population, anti-seizure medications do not control seizures. Many patients pursue surgical treatment that can include a procedure involving the implantation of electrodes for intracranial monitoring of seizure activity. For these cases, accurate mapping of the implanted electrodes on a patient’s brain is crucial in planning the ultimate surgical treatment. Traditionally, electrode mapping results are presented in static figures that do not allow for dynamic interactions and visualizations. In collaboration with a clinical research team at a Level 4 Epilepsy Center, we developed N-Tools-Browser, a web-based software using WebGL and the X-Toolkit (XTK), to help clinicians interactively visualize the location and functional properties of implanted intracranial electrodes in 3D. Our software allows the user to visualize the seizure focus location accurately and simultaneously display functional characteristics (e.g., results from electrical stimulation mapping). Different visualization modes enable the analysis of multiple electrode groups or individual anatomical locations. We deployed a prototype of N-Tools-Browser for our collaborators at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. Then, we evaluated its usefulness with domain experts on clinical cases.},

ABSTRACT = {The fourth industrial revolution in 2011 aimed to transform the traditional manufacturing processes. As part of this revolution, disruptive innovations in drug development and data science approaches have the potential to optimize CMC (chemistry, manufacture, and control). The real-time simulation of processes using &ldquo;digital twins&rdquo; can maximize efficiency while improving sustainability. As part of this review, we investigate how the World Health Organization&rsquo;s 17 sustainability goals can apply toward next-generation drug development. We analyze the state-of-the-art laboratory leadership, inclusive personnel recruiting, the latest therapy approaches, and intelligent process automation. We also outline how modern data science techniques and machine tools for CMC help to shorten drug development time, reduce failure rates, and minimize resource usage. Finally, we systematically analyze and compare existing approaches to our experiences with the high-throughput laboratory KIWI-biolab at the TU Berlin. We describe a sustainable business model that accelerates scientific innovations and supports global action toward a sustainable future.},

    abstract={CellProfiler Analyst (CPA) has enabled the scientific research community to explore image-based data and classify complex biological phenotypes through an interactive user interface since its release in 2008. This paper describes CellProfiler Analyst Web (CPAW), a newly redesigned and web-based version of the software, allowing for greater accessibility, quicker setup, and facilitating a simple workflow for users. Installation and managing new versions has been challenging and time-consuming, historically. CPAW is an alternative that ensures installation and future updates are not a hassle to the user. CPAW ports the core iteration loop of CPA to a pure server-less browser environment using modern web-development technologies, allowing computationally heavy activities, like machine learning, to occur without freezing the user interface (UI). With a setup as simple as navigating to a website, CPAW presents a clean UI to the user to refine their classifier and explore phenotypic data easily. We evaluated both the old and the new version of the software in an extensive domain expert study. We found that users could complete the essential classification tasks in CPAW and CPA 3.0 with the same efficiency. Additionally, users completed the tasks 20 percent faster using CPAW compared to CPA 3.0.

    abstract={Tractography from high-dimensional diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data allows brain’s structural connectivity analysis. Recent dMRI studies aim to compare connectivity patterns across subject groups and disease populations to understand subtle abnormalities in the brain’s white matter connectivity and distributions of biologically sensitive dMRI derived metrics. Existing software products focus solely on the anatomy, are not intuitive or restrict the comparison of multiple subjects. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of FiberStars, a visual analysis tool for tractography data that allows the interactive visualization of brainfiber clusters combining existing 3D anatomy with compact 2D visualizations. With FiberStars, researchers can analyze and compare multiple subjects in large collections of brain fibers using different views.  To evaluate the usability of our software, we performed a quantitative user study. We asked domain experts and non-experts to find patterns in a tractography dataset with either FiberStars or an existing dMRI exploration tool. Our results show that participants using FiberStars can navigate extensive collections of tractography faster and more accurately. All our research, software, and results are available openly.},

  abstract={For large-scale vision tasks in biomedical images, the labeled data is often limited to train effective deep models. Active learning is a common solution, where a query suggestion method selects representative unlabeled samples for annotation, and the new labels are used to improve the base model. However, most query suggestion models optimize their learnable parameters only on the limited labeled data and consequently become less effective for the more challenging unlabeled data. To tackle this, we propose a two-stream active query suggestion approach. In addition to the supervised feature extractor, we introduce an unsupervised one optimized on all raw images to capture diverse image features, which can later be improved by fine-tuning on new labels. As a use case, we build an end-to-end active learning framework with our query suggestion method for 3D synapse detection and mitochondria segmentation in connectomics. With the framework, we curate, to our best knowledge, the largest connectomics dataset with dense synapses and mitochondria annotation.},

    author={Lekschas, Fritz and Peterson, Brant and Haehn, Daniel and Ma, Eric and Gehlenborg, Nils and Pfister, Hanspeter},
    abstract={We present Peax, a novel feature-based technique for interactive visual pattern search in sequential data, like time series or data mapped to a genome sequence. Visually searching for patterns by similarity is often challenging because of the large search space, the visual complexity of patterns, and the user’s perception of similarity. For example, in genomics, researchers try to link patterns in multivariate sequential data to cellular or pathogenic processes, but a lack of ground truth and high variance makes automatic pattern detection unreliable. We have developed a convolutional autoencoder for unsupervised representation learning of regions in sequential data that can capture more visual details of complex patterns compared to existing similarity measures. Using this learned representation as features of the sequential data, our accompanying visual query system enables interactive feedback-driven adjustments of the pattern search to adapt to the users’ perceived similarity. Using an active learning sampling strategy, Peax collects user-generated binary relevance feedback. This feedback is used to train a model for binary classification, to ultimately find other regions that exhibit patterns similar to the search target. We demonstrate Peax’s features through a case study in genomics and report on a user study with eight domain experts to assess the usability and usefulness of Peax. Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of the learned feature representation for visual similarity search in two additional user studies. We find that our models retrieve significantly more similar patterns than other commonly used techniques.},

    author={Matejek, Brian and \myname{Haehn, Daniel} and Zhu, Haidong and Wei, Donglai and Parag, Toufiq and Pfister, Hanspeter},
    abstract={Most current state-of-the-art connectome reconstruction pipelines have two major steps: initial pixel-based segmentation with affinity prediction and watershed transform, and refined segmentation by merging over-segmented regions. These methods rely only on local context and are typically agnostic to the underlying biology. Since a few merge errors can lead to several incorrectly merged neuronal processes, these algorithms are currently tuned towards over-segmentation producing an overburden of costly proofreading. We propose a third step for connectomics reconstruction pipelines to refine an over-segmentation using both local and global context with an emphasis on adhering to the underlying biology. We first extract a graph from an input segmentation where nodes correspond to segment labels and edges indicate potential split errors in the over-segmentation. In order to increase throughput and allow for large-scale reconstruction, we employ biologically inspired geometric constraints based on neuron morphology to reduce the number of nodes and edges. Next, two neural networks learn these neuronal shapes to further aid the graph construction process. Lastly, we reformulate the region merging problem as a graph partitioning one to leverage global context. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on four real-world connectomics datasets with an average variation of information improvement of 21.3%.},

  abstract={Convolutional neural networks can successfully perform many computer vision tasks on images. For visualization, how do CNNs perform when applied to graphical perception tasks? We investigate this question by reproducing Cleveland and McGill’s seminal 1984 experiments, which measured human perception efficiency of different visual encodings and defined elementary perceptual tasks for visualization. We measure the graphical perceptual capabilities of four network architectures on five different visualization tasks and compare to existing and new human performance baselines. While under limited circumstances CNNs are able to meet or outperform human task performance, we find that CNNs are not currently a good model for human graphical perception. We present the results of these experiments to foster the understanding of how CNNs succeed and fail when applied to data visualizations.},

    abstract={Automatic cell image segmentation methods in connectomics produce merge and split errors, which require correction through proofreading. Previous research has identified the visual search for these errors as the bottleneck in interactive proofreading. To aid error correction, we develop two classifiers that automatically recommend candidate merges and splits to the user. These classifiers use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained with errors in automatic segmentations against expert-labeled ground truth. Our classifiers detect potentially-erroneous regions by considering a large context region around a segmentation boundary. Corrections can then be performed by a user with yes/no decisions, which reduces variation of information 7.5x faster than previous proofreading methods. We also present a fully-automatic mode that uses a probability threshold to make merge/split decisions. Extensive experiments using the automatic approach and comparing performance of novice and expert users demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art proofreading methods on different connectomics datasets.},

  title={Compresso: Efficient Compression of Segmentation Data For Connectomics},
  author={Matejek, Brian and \myname{Haehn, Daniel} and Lekschas, Fritz and Mitzenmacher, Michael and Pfister, Hanspeter},
  abstract={Recent advances in segmentation methods for connectomics and biomedical imaging produce very large datasets with labels that assign object classes to image pixels. The resulting label volumes are bigger than the raw image data and need compression for efficient storage and transfer. General-purpose compression methods are less effective because the label data consists of large low-frequency regions with structured boundaries unlike natural image data. We present Compresso, a new compression scheme for label data that outperforms existing approaches by using a sliding window to exploit redundancy across border regions in 2D and 3D. We compare our method to existing compression schemes and provide a detailed evaluation on eleven biomedical and image segmentation datasets. Our method provides a factor of 600-2200x compression for label volumes, with running times suitable for practice.},

  author={Gonda, Felix and Kaynig, Verena and Jones, Thouis R. and \myname{Haehn, Daniel} and Lichtman, Jeff W. and Parag, Toufiq and Pfister, Hanspeter},
  abstract={We present an interactive approach to train a deep neural network pixel classifier for the segmentation of neuronal structures. An interactive training scheme reduces the extremely tedious manual annotation task that is typically required for deep networks to perform well on image segmentation problems. Our proposed method employs a feedback loop that captures sparse annotations using a graphical user interface, trains a deep neural network based on recent and past annotations, and displays the prediction output to users in almost real-time. Our implementation of the algorithm also allows multiple users to provide annotations in parallel and receive feedback from the same classifier. Quick feedback on classifier performance in an interactive setting enables users to identify and label examples that are more important than others for segmentation purposes. Our experiments show that an interactively-trained pixel classifier produces better region segmentation results on Electron Microscopy (EM) images than those generated by a network of the same architecture trained offline on exhaustive ground-truth labels.},

  abstract={Connectomics is the study of the dense structure of the neurons in the brain and their synapses, providing new insights into the relation between braintextquoterights structure and its function. Recent advances in Electron Microscopy enable high-resolution imaging (4nm per pixel) of neural tissue at a rate of roughly 10 terapixels in a single day, allowing neuroscientists to capture large blocks of neural tissue in a reasonable amount of time. The large amounts of data require novel computer vision based algorithms and scalable software frameworks to process this data. We describe RhoANA, our dense Automatic Neural Annotation framework, which we have developed in order to automatically align, segment and reconstruct a 1mm^3 brain tissue (~2 peta-pixels).},

  author={Al-Awami, Ali K. and Beyer, Johanna and \myname{Haehn, Daniel} and Kasthuri, Narayanan and Lichtman, Jeff W. and Pfister, Hanspeter and Hadwiger, Markus},
  abstract={In the field of connectomics, neuroscientists acquire electron microscopy volumes at nanometer resolution in order to reconstruct a detailed wiring diagram of the neurons in the brain. The resulting image volumes, which often are hundreds of terabytes in size, need to be segmented to identify cell boundaries, synapses, and important cell organelles. However, the segmentation process of a single volume is very complex, time-intensive, and usually performed using a diverse set of tools and many users. To tackle the associated challenges, this paper presents NeuroBlocks, which is a novel visualization system for tracking the state, progress, and evolution of very large volumetric segmentation data in neuroscience. NeuroBlocks is a multi-user web-based application that seamlessly integrates the diverse set of tools that neuroscientists currently use for manual and semi-automatic segmentation, proofreading, visualization, and analysis. NeuroBlocks is the first system that integrates this heterogeneous tool set, providing crucial support for the management, provenance, accountability, and auditing of large-scale segmentations. We describe the design of NeuroBlocks, starting with an analysis of the domain-specific tasks, their inherent challenges, and our subsequent task abstraction and visual representation. We demonstrate the utility of our design based on two case studies that focus on different user roles and their respective requirements for performing and tracking the progress of segmentation and proofreading in a large real-world connectomics project.},

  abstract={The rodent brain is organized with length scales spanning centimeters to nanometers &mdash;6 orders of magnitude. At the centimeter scale, the brain consist of lobes of cortex, the cerebellum, the brainstem and the spinal cord. The millimeter scale have neurons arranged in columns, layers, or otherwise clustered. Recent technological imaging advances allow the generation of neuronal datasets spanning the spatial range from nanometers to 100s of microns. Collecting a 1 mm^3 volume dataset of brain tissue at 4 nm x-y resolution using the fastest signal-beam SEM would require ~6 years. To move to the next length and volume scale of neuronal circuits requires several technological advances. The multibeam scanning electron microscope (mSEM) represents a transformative imaging technology that enables neuroscientists to tackle millimeter scale cortical circuit problems. In this work we describe a workflow from tissue harvest to imaging that will generate a 2 petabyte dataset (> 300,000,000 images) of rat visual cortex imaged at a 4nm x 4nm x-y (Nyquist sampling of membranes) and 30nm section thickness in less than 6 months.},

  author={Im, Kiho and Ahtam, Banu and \myname{Haehn, Daniel} and Peters, Jurriaan M. and Warfield, Simon K. and Sahin, Mustafa and Grant, P. Ellen},
  abstract={Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by benign hamartomas in multiple organs including the brain and its clinical phenotypes may be associated with abnormal neural connections. We aimed to provide the first detailed findings on disrupted structural brain networks in TSC patients. Structural whole-brain connectivity maps were constructed using structural and diffusion MRI in 20 TSC (age range: 3–24 years) and 20 typically developing (TD; 3–23 years) subjects. We assessed global (short and long-association and interhemispheric fibers) and regional white matter connectivity, and performed graph theoretical analysis using gyral pattern- and atlas-based node parcellations. Significantly higher mean diffusivity (MD) was shown in TSC patients than in TD controls throughout the whole brain and positively correlated with tuber load severity. A significant increase in MD was mainly influenced by an increase in radial diffusivity. Furthermore, interhemispheric connectivity was particularly reduced in TSC, which leads to increased network segregation within hemispheres. TSC patients with developmental delay (DD) showed significantly higher MD than those without DD primarily in intrahemispheric connections. Our analysis allows nonbiased determination of differential white matter involvement, which may provide better measures of "lesion load" and lead to a better understanding of disease mechanisms.},

  author={\myname{Haehn, Daniel} and Knowles-Barley, Seymour and Roberts, Mike and Beyer, Johanna and Kasthuri, Narayanan and Lichtman, Jeff W. and Pfister, Hanspeter},
  abstract={Proofreading refers to the manual correction of automatic segmentations of image data. In connectomics, electron microscopy data is acquired at nanometer-scale resolution and results in very large image volumes of brain tissue that require fully automatic segmentation algorithms to identify cell boundaries. However, these algorithms require hundreds of corrections per cubic micron of tissue. Even though this task is time consuming, it is fairly easy for humans to perform corrections through splitting, merging, and adjusting segments during proofreading. In this paper we present the design and implementation of Mojo, a fully-featured single-user desktop application for proofreading, and Dojo, a multi-user web-based application for collaborative proofreading. We evaluate the accuracy and speed of Mojo, Dojo, and Raveler, a proofreading tool from Janelia Farm, through a quantitative user study. We designed a between-subjects experiment and asked non-experts to proofread neurons in a publicly available connectomics dataset. Our results show a significant improvement of corrections using web-based Dojo even in comparison to fully manual expert segmentation, when given the same amount of time. In addition, all participants using Dojo reported better usability. We discuss our findings and provide an analysis of requirements for designing visual proofreading software.},

  TITLE={Neuroimaging in the Browser using the X Toolkit},
  ABSTRACT={WebGL is recent technology that exposes a computer's GPU to a browser, and allows for the native generation of rich three dimensional graphics. Compatible web browsers can offer a graphical experience comparable to more traditional stand-alone programs. As such WebGL offers the potential of bringing the "web" to neuroscience, and has great potential to accelerate and support scientific research. Cognisant of these possibilities, we present 'The X Toolkit' (XTK), the first JavaScript-based framework for visualizing and interacting with medical imaging data using WebGL.},

  abstract={Elucidation of infant brain development is a critically important goal given the enduring impact of these early processes on various domains including later cognition and language. Although infants' whole-brain growth rates have long been available, regional growth rates have not been reported systematically. Accordingly, relatively less is known about the dynamics and organization of typically developing infant brains. Here we report global and regional volumetric growth of cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem with gender dimorphism, in 33 cross-sectional scans, over 3 to 13 months, using T1-weighted 3-dimensional spoiled gradient echo images and detailed semi-automated brain segmentation. Except for the midbrain and lateral ventricles, all absolute volumes of brain regions showed significant growth, with 6 different patterns of volumetric change. When normalized to the whole brain, the regional increase was characterized by 5 differential patterns. The putamen, cerebellar hemispheres, and total cerebellum were the only regions that showed positive growth in the normalized brain. Our results show region-specific patterns of volumetric change and contribute to the systematic understanding of infant brain development. This study greatly expands our knowledge of normal development and in future may provide a basis for identifying early deviation above and beyond normative variation that might signal higher risk for neurological disorders.},

  ABSTRACT={The Mindboggle project automates anatomical brain labeling, feature extraction and identification, and shape analysis of brain regions and features. This generates a lot of data, which presents a challenge for visualization and comparison across brains. In the past, it would have been untenable to present rich, three-dimensional data interactively and online within a web browser, but recent developments in WebGL libraries have made it possible. XTK is the first WebGL library geared towards 3D medical imaging data.
